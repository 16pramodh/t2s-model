# Text-to-SQL Model

This project allows users to interact with SQL databases using **plain English queries**. A fine-tuned model takes a natural language query and the table's schema (CREATE TABLE statement) to automatically generate the corresponding SQL query.

## Features

1. **Main**
   - Query one of three predefined tables.
   - Only `SELECT` queries are allowed.
   - View the structure of the tables under the **DBInfo** section.
   - The backend API (hosted on Render) handles these queries and returns results.

2. **Test**
   - Provide your own table schema (via a simple `CREATE TABLE` command) as context.
   - Get the corresponding SQL query generated by the model.
   - The model is hosted on a Hugging Face Space and acts like an API.

**Example Table Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
    var1 type NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ...
    varN type
);
